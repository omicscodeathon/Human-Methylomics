DNA methylation is perhaps the most extensively studied epigenetic modification in mammals this is because it directly inhibit the expression of genes and also increases the probability that affected genes undergo a mutational events. Although DNA methylation plays an essential role in normal biological processes, distinct and abnormal patterns of methylation are observed in cancers. Through this study, we aim to identify cancer markers by analyzing datasets of different cancers and comparing the obtained results to highlight the similarities.
